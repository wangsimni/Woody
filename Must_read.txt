****IMPORTANT********

All Personnel who is taking part of this project may read this with full caution.
Some rules for employees have been updated.


1. Everyone should participate in occasional meeting such as eating lunch or chicken together unless his/her parents are dead.

2. Don't read this second rule. It's useless.

3. From now on, we'll have a simple presentation meeting once a week. All personnel must prepare a presentation about certain topics.
Topics can be given, or they can be free-to-choose. We'll announce that a week ago from the presentation day.


Glory to Artotzka
